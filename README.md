# Gravio Gauge

The Gravio Gauge can show sensor data from physical motion, magnet contact, button or Gravio Software Sesors in a HTML based gauge. A typical example would be that a camera software sensor would count the amount of people in a picture via Gravio and then passes that information on to this gauge.

# Prerequisites
- You will need Gravio (www.gravio.com) for this to work.
- Gravio needs to be in the same network so this gauge can pull the information from there frequently
- You need to ensure that the browser can request the data from the server. For Firefox, please download: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/
